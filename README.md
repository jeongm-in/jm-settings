One repository for syncing program settings across different systems

# Bill of Materials
- `.zshrc`: contains zsh settings and aliases I use in WSL
- `chocolatey-install.bat`: powershell script to install chocolatey and programs from the `package.txt`
- `package.txt`: list of applications I install on a new Windows 10 system 
- `link_Korean_font_to_Consolas.reg`: binds Naver's Nanum Gothic font to Consolas font set for Korean characters.
- `keybindings.json`: custom VSCode shortcut settings. Mix of JetBrain style shortcuts. 
- `reset-adapter.bat`: stop and start ethernet adapter automatically. Workaround for Windows 10 intermittently losing network connection after upgrading to version 2004.
